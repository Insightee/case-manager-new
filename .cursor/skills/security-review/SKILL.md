## InsighteCase specifics (read first)

**Highest-risk area in this repo is authorization, not injection.** For every endpoint touched, prove:

| Role | Must only reach |
|------|-----------------|
| Parent | Own family's cases, sessions, reports, invoices. Never margin, payout, therapist pay, other families. |
| Therapist | Cases with an active `case_assignments` row (history aware, not `case.therapist_id` alone), own logs, invoices, tickets, profile. **No** client billing data. |
| Case manager / admin / finance / HR | Gated by permissions and product modules (`backend/app/core/modules.py`, `docs/RBAC_SCOPE.md`, `docs/REVIEW_ROLE_MATRIX.md`). |

Checks that must appear in the report:
- **IDOR:** change the `{case_id}` / `{session_id}` / `{invoice_id}` / `{report_id}` in the URL to another family's or therapist's record. Is it a 403/404? Is there a test?
- **Mass assignment:** Pydantic request models must not accept `role`, `therapist_id`, `status`, amounts or `case_id` that the caller may not set.
- **Write side effects on GET:** list endpoints must not commit (past bugs: SLA escalation and auto-ending sessions inside list GETs).
- **Notifications and deep links:** never leak another family's names or link a parent to an admin route (`frontend/src/components/shared/notificationLinks.js`).
- **Exports/PDFs:** same scoping as the screen. Exports must not include columns hidden on screen.
- **Secrets:** never print tokens, `DATABASE_URL` or env values in the report, logs, or PR. Run `./scripts/check_staged_secrets.sh` before committing.
- Compare against `docs/SECURITY_AUDIT.md` so known issues are not re-reported as new.

**Output:** write the report into the PR description (or a PR comment) under `## Security review`. Do not open issues, post elsewhere, or change production config. Fixes go in the same PR only if in scope; otherwise list them.

# Security Review Skill

Identify exploitable security vulnerabilities in code. Report only **HIGH CONFIDENCE** findings—clear vulnerable patterns with attacker-controlled input.

## Scope: Research vs. Reporting

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**

- **Report on**: Only the specific file, diff, or code you were asked to review (default: `git diff origin/main...HEAD`)
- **Research**: The ENTIRE codebase to build confidence before reporting

Before flagging any issue, you MUST research the codebase to understand:
- Where does this input actually come from? (Trace data flow)
- Is there validation/sanitization elsewhere?
- How is this configured? (Check settings, config files, middleware)
- What framework protections exist?

**Do NOT report issues based solely on pattern matching.** Investigate first, then report only what you're confident is exploitable.

## Confidence Levels

| Level | Criteria | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **HIGH** | Vulnerable pattern + attacker-controlled input confirmed | **Report** with severity |
| **MEDIUM** | Vulnerable pattern, input source unclear | **Note** as "Needs verification" |
| **LOW** | Theoretical, best practice, defense-in-depth | **Do not report** |

## Do Not Flag

### General Rules
- Test files (unless explicitly reviewing test security)
- Dead code, commented code, documentation strings
- Patterns using **constants** or **server-controlled configuration**
- Code paths that require prior authentication to reach (note the auth requirement instead)

### Server-Controlled Values (NOT Attacker-Controlled)

These are configured by operators, not controlled by attackers:

| Source | Example | Why It's Safe |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Django settings | `settings.API_URL`, `settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Set via config/env at deployment |
| Environment variables | `os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')` | Deployment configuration |
| Config files | `config.yaml`, `app.config['KEY']` | Server-side files |
| Framework constants | `django.conf.settings.*` | Not user-modifiable |
| Hardcoded values | `BASE_URL = "https://api.internal"` | Compile-time constants |

**SSRF Example - NOT a vulnerability:**
```python
# SAFE: URL comes from Django settings (server-controlled)
response = requests.get(f"{settings.SEER_AUTOFIX_URL}{path}")
```

**SSRF Example - IS a vulnerability:**
```python
# VULNERABLE: URL comes from request (attacker-controlled)
response = requests.get(request.GET.get('url'))
```

### Framework-Mitigated Patterns
Check language guides before flagging. Common false positives:

| Pattern | Why It's Usually Safe |
|---------|----------------------|
| Django `{{ variable }}` | Auto-escaped by default |
| React `{variable}` | Auto-escaped by default |
| Vue `{{ variable }}` | Auto-escaped by default |
| `User.objects.filter(id=input)` / SQLAlchemy `select(User).where(User.id == x)` | ORM parameterizes queries |
| `cursor.execute("...%s", (input,))` | Parameterized query |
| `innerHTML = "<b>Loading...</b>"` | Constant string, no user input |

**Only flag these when:**
- Django: `{{ var|safe }}`, `{% autoescape off %}`, `mark_safe(user_input)`
- React: `dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: userInput}}`
- Vue: `v-html="userInput"`
- ORM: `.raw()`, `.extra()`, `RawSQL()`, SQLAlchemy `text(f"...")` with string interpolation

## Review Process

### 1. Detect Context

What type of code am I reviewing?

| Code Type | Load These References |
|-----------|----------------------|
| API endpoints, routes | `authorization.md`, `authentication.md`, `injection.md` |
| Frontend, templates | `xss.md`, `csrf.md` |
| File handling, uploads | `file-security.md` |
| Crypto, secrets, tokens | `cryptography.md`, `data-protection.md` |
| Data serialization | `deserialization.md` |
| External requests | `ssrf.md` |
| Business workflows | `business-logic.md` |
| GraphQL, REST design | `api-security.md` |
| Config, headers, CORS | `misconfiguration.md` |
| CI/CD, dependencies | `supply-chain.md` |
| Error handling | `error-handling.md` |
| Audit, logging | `logging.md` |

### 2. Load Language Guide

Based on file extension or imports:

| Indicators | Guide |
|------------|-------|
| `.py`, `django`, `flask`, `fastapi` | `languages/python.md` (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy here) |
| `.js`, `.ts`, `express`, `react`, `vue`, `next` | `languages/javascript.md` |

### 3. Load Infrastructure Guide (if applicable)

| File Type | Guide |
|-----------|-------|
| `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore` | `infrastructure/docker.md` |

### 4. Research Before Flagging

**For each potential issue, research the codebase to build confidence:**

- Where does this value actually come from? Trace the data flow.
- Is it configured at deployment (settings, env vars) or from user input?
- Is there validation, sanitization, or allowlisting elsewhere?
- What framework protections apply?

Only report issues where you have HIGH confidence after understanding the broader context.

### 5. Verify Exploitability

For each potential finding, confirm:

**Is the input attacker-controlled?**

| Attacker-Controlled (Investigate) | Server-Controlled (Usually Safe) |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `request.GET`, `request.POST`, `request.args` | `settings.X`, `app.config['X']` |
| `request.json`, `request.data`, `request.body` | `os.environ.get('X')` |
| `request.headers` (most headers) | Hardcoded constants |
| `request.cookies` (unsigned) | Internal service URLs from config |
| URL path segments: `/users/<id>/` | Database content from admin/system |
| File uploads (content and names) | Signed session data |
| Database content from other users | Framework settings |
| WebSocket messages | |

**Does the framework mitigate this?**
- Check language guide for auto-escaping, parameterization
- Check for middleware/decorators that sanitize

**Is there validation upstream?**
- Input validation before this code
- Sanitization libraries (DOMPurify, bleach, etc.)

### 6. Report HIGH Confidence Only

Skip theoretical issues. Report only what you've confirmed is exploitable after research.

## Severity Classification

| Severity | Impact | Examples |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Critical** | Direct exploit, severe impact, no auth required | RCE, SQL injection to data, auth bypass, hardcoded secrets |
| **High** | Exploitable with conditions, significant impact | Stored XSS, SSRF to metadata, IDOR to sensitive data |
| **Medium** | Specific conditions required, moderate impact | Reflected XSS, CSRF on state-changing actions, path traversal |
| **Low** | Defense-in-depth, minimal direct impact | Missing headers, verbose errors, weak algorithms in non-critical context |

## Quick Patterns Reference

### Always Flag (Critical)
```
eval(user_input)           # Any language
exec(user_input)           # Any language
pickle.loads(user_data)    # Python
yaml.load(user_data)       # Python (not safe_load)
unserialize($user_data)    # PHP
deserialize(user_data)     # Java ObjectInputStream
shell=True + user_input    # Python subprocess
child_process.exec(user)   # Node.js
```

### Always Flag (High)
```
innerHTML = userInput              # DOM XSS
dangerouslySetInnerHTML={user}     # React XSS
v-html="userInput"                 # Vue XSS
f"SELECT * FROM x WHERE {user}"    # SQL injection
`SELECT * FROM x WHERE ${user}`    # SQL injection
os.system(f"cmd {user_input}")     # Command injection
```

### Always Flag (Secrets)
```
password = "hardcoded"
api_key = "sk-..."
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "..."
private_key = "-----BEGIN"
```

### Check Context First (MUST Investigate Before Flagging)
```
# SSRF - ONLY if URL is from user input, NOT from settings/config
requests.get(request.GET['url'])     # FLAG: User-controlled URL
requests.get(settings.API_URL)       # SAFE: Server-controlled config
requests.get(f"{settings.BASE}/{x}") # CHECK: Is 'x' user input?

# Path traversal - ONLY if path is from user input
open(request.GET['file'])            # FLAG: User-controlled path
open(settings.LOG_PATH)              # SAFE: Server-controlled config
open(f"{BASE_DIR}/{filename}")       # CHECK: Is 'filename' user input?

# Open redirect - ONLY if URL is from user input
redirect(request.GET['next'])        # FLAG: User-controlled redirect
redirect(settings.LOGIN_URL)         # SAFE: Server-controlled config

# Weak crypto - ONLY if used for security purposes
hashlib.md5(file_content)            # SAFE: File checksums, caching
hashlib.md5(password)                # FLAG: Password hashing
random.random()                      # SAFE: Non-security uses (UI, sampling)
random.random() for token            # FLAG: Security tokens need secrets module
```
