## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Voice Session Log V2 Phase 2: Clinical Language Engine (`clinical_language_engine_service.py`), compact session context builder, extended extraction schema v2, honest 3-stage processing UI. Flags: `ENABLE_VOICE_SESSION_V2`, `ENABLE_CLINICAL_LANGUAGE_ENGINE` (default off).
- Progress report engine: `progress_report_service` + builder/preview UI, evidence scope/review helpers (`docs/PROGRESS_REPORT_RULES.md`).
- Case Insights **Ask** sub-tab: case-scoped chatbot with weekly cap (`insights_ask_service`, `POST /cases/{id}/insights/ask`).
- Clinical brain & session-log canonicalisation: product docs (`docs/product/*`), `DESIGN.md`, `canonical-manifest.yml`, Cursor rule `insighte-clinical-canonical.mdc`; `SessionLogApplicationService` (single write entry), `SessionEvidenceProjection` + preview/build services; time audit table; deprecated route adapters with usage gates.
- Voice-first session log is now the **canonical editor** on all therapist routes (logs page, case detail, edit/resubmit) — frontend flag removed; "Type instead" opens the same structured draft. New clinical confirmation sections: session context header with audited time edit, emerging goal candidates → CM review queue, strategies used today (active / other / max-2 deterministic recommendations), child response signals, challenges with CM flag + incident link (never auto-created), deterministic session insights, family + clinical preview tabs. Legacy prose logs adapt into the draft via `legacyLogToStructuredSession`; all new data lives in `structured_session_json` (no migration).
- Team workflow: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, PR template, CODEOWNERS, pre-push/pre-release scripts, pre-commit hooks, CI contributor guards.
- RBAC editor: bulk Select all / Clear all for service categories, multi-select dropdown, unified clinical features panel.
- People module: central invite policy (max 2 pending per email, one role per email), uniform row actions (staff/therapists/clients), bulk activate/deactivate and bulk invite cancel, client Deactivated when all cases closed with reactivate case flow, case CM edit modal.
- `user.read` permission for Case Manager and Supervisor — read-only Staff directory in People without account management.
- People directory loads all user pages (not just first 100); server-side search by email/name.

### Changed
- Therapist onboarding pre-selects only **Homecare** and **Shadow support** by default (not every service category).
- **@antigravity** — Enforced role-specific portal logins on backend and frontend, preventing users from logging in via incorrect portal URLs.
- **@antigravity** — Allowed SUPER_ADMIN, ADMIN, and MODULE_ADMIN users to view the Case Manager home dashboard.
- People → Clients: family list includes case status, `allCasesClosed`, and primary case id for actions.
- Pending invite UI explains cancel vs post-registration login paths.

### Fixed
- Voice Session Log V2 Phase 3–5: mobile review accordions, Clinical Brain insight panel, family preview from confirmed evidence only, longitudinal insight services, analytics events on submit.
- Use current location: reverse geocode now uses API base URL (works on Vercel production).
- Security: active portal users no longer hidden from People when total users exceeds 100.

## [2026-06-09]

Therapist org IDs on People and duplicate-child prevention on family onboarding.

### Added
- **Therapist ID** — optional `external_employee_id` on therapist create, onboard, and bulk CSV import; **People → Therapists** shows an editable **Therapist ID** column (HR’s existing reference, separate from internal `users.id`).
- Duplicate-child guard on `POST /api/v1/admin/families` and `POST /api/v1/admin/children`: blocks a second child profile for the same parent when first name, last name, and date of birth match an existing linked child.

### Fixed
- Parent portal **Your Active Cases** listed closed and suspended cases; `/api/v1/parent/cases` and `/api/v1/parent/home` now return only `ACTIVE` and `PENDING_ALLOTMENT` cases (direct case URLs still work for history).
- Admin family onboarding could create duplicate client rows for one parent email (same child entered twice); API now returns 400 with the existing child id.

## [2026-05-30]

Support hub, finance/HR ops, billing UX, and environment documentation (`e7d9436`).

### Added
- Support access service and `GET /api/v1/admin/support/capabilities` for hub tab visibility.
- HR reports API/page and finance overview/reports/bulk ops endpoints.
- Demo support tickets in seed data; `test_support_access.py`, finance/HR report tests.
- `docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`, expanded `docs/README.md`, support/HR handover and ADR-0001.

### Changed
- Admin support hub and sidebar use server capabilities; `tickets`/`incidents` features on billing and hr_ops modules.
- Invoice composer, client billing tabs, therapist payouts dashboard UX.
- Session log test isolation via `session_helpers.py`; incident PATCH requires incidents module feature with DB session.

### Fixed
- Profile session log tests under shared CI DB; incident patch 403 for case managers missing `db` on feature check.
